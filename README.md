# HLML project: Active Learning with Noisy labels 

This notebook contains the code for the human-in-the-loop project by Jelke Matthijsse (student no.: 12653500) that explores the influence of noisy labels on the classification performance of active learning acquisition functions on a multi-class classification task of the MNIST dataset.

This code is partly a collaborative of Dennis Agafonov and Jelke Matthijsse. Both had an HLML project regarding active learning on the multi-class classification task on MNIST, which allowed some code-sharing. A part of the code differs, since Dennis researched different batch sizes, while Jelke researched noisy labels. The parts of the code considering these specifics are therefore written independently.
